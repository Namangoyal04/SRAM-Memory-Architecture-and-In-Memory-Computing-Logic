# SRAM-Memory-Architecture-and-In-Memory-Computing-Logic
## Introduction
* In-memory computing (IMC) processes data directly within memory arrays, reducing the need to 
transfer data between memory and separate processing units like CPUs or GPUs.
* This approach minimizes latency and energy consumption by cutting down on data movement, 
enhancing performance efficiency.

*  In Von-Neumann Architecture, the CPU and memory are separate, causing data to move between them for processing and creating a bottleneck due to limited bandwidth
